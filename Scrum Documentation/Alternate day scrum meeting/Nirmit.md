## What tasks did I work on?
I worked on my part of the sample app. I decided to change things though to fit the game more. I decided to implement the Super Power for Thor. Instead of making it spread out from the character I made it drop from the sky at random locations for a period of time. Also instead of causing damage, the attacks kill the enemy in one shot.
## What am I planning to work next?
I will work on looking for ways to refactor the code to use design patterns and make it more efficient.
## Blockers
I was unsure of the direction to take the game. For example, can the weapon be upgraded? When is the super power launched? After some discussion with the team, we decided on a more concrete direction.

## Blockers
Currently there are no blockers from my side.
